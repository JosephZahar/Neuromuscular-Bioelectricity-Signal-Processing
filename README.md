# Neuromuscular-Bioelectricity-Signal-Processing
An analysis of muscle activation, when increasing the repetitions of a single-arm dumbbell curl, supported by raw data of muscular activity obtained from sensors and processed using MATLAB

Surface EMG signals were recorded on the right arm from the biceps femoris, the triceps brachii, the flexor digitorum superficialis (anterior part of the forearm), and dorsal interossei (back of the hand). These allowed us to obtain data from each muscle during dynamic performance and to compare it to the reference electrode. The reference electrode is generally positioned to an electrically unaffected and nearby area (connective tissue) and is useful to detect internal and external noises
